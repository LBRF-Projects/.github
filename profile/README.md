This is the home for our lab's project-specific experimental paradigms. The purpose of this page is to archive copies of the code used to collect data for studies completed in the LBRF.

The lab's hompage can be found here [LBRF](https://github.com/LBRF).

The open-access analysis pipleines for our studies can be found in the [LBRF Pipeline Repository](https://github.com/LBRF-Pipelines).
